# The Neighborhood Map Project
**Never be alone with Emergent 911's Neighborhood Map!**

Welcome to my Neighborhood Map Project! Udacity has challenged me to piece together a website that utilizes Google Maps and at least one other location-based API. Of course, given my venturous coder mentality, I had to take one for the team and accept the challenge!

For my project, I have chosen to intertwine [Google Maps' JavaScript API] (http://bit.ly/2DTmniw) with [Foursquare's Search For Venues API] (http://bit.ly/2I1X4x9) in order to create am application that showcase hospitals :hospital: and police stations :oncoming_police_car: in or nearby McDonough, Georgia.

This application allows you to easily search for a nearby hospital or police station. Not sure of where to start? No worries because a list of all the local police stations and hospitals are listed in the app!

If you select a location in the list, you'll be able to see exactly where it's located, and in some cases, you'll be able to see the phone number for the site--props to Foursquare API for that!

## The Inspiration Behind The Map
----------------------------------------------
Now, you may be wondering what Emergent 911 has to do with any of this. I'm currently in the process of developing a text-to-911 app called Emergent 911, and one of the features of the app is that it will not only be able to tell you exactly where you are located, but it will also tell you which hospitals and police stations are closest to you.

So you know when Udacity asked me to create a neighborhood map project, there was no way I could resist paying homage to Emergent! I hope to be releasing Emergent 911 in the Google Play and Apple App Store later this year so if you are interested in receiving updates, be sure to subscribe to the Emergent 911 newsletter here: http://bit.ly/mailing_e911!
